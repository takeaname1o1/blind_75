# [121. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock](https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock/description/)

You are given an array <code>prices</code> where <code>prices[i]</code> is the price of a given stock on the <code>i^th</code> day.

You want to maximize your profit by choosing a **single day**  to buy one stock and choosing a **different day in the future**  to sell that stock.

Return the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction. If you cannot achieve any profit, return <code>0</code>.

**Example 1:** 

```
Input: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 5
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.
Note that buying on day 2 and selling on day 1 is not allowed because you must buy before you sell.
```

**Example 2:** 

```
Input: prices = [7,6,4,3,1]
Output: 0
Explanation: In this case, no transactions are done and the max profit = 0.
```

**Constraints:** 

- <code>1 <= prices.length <= 10^5</code>
- <code>0 <= prices[i] <= 10^4</code>



```cpp

    int maxProfit(const vector<int>& prices) {
        int n = prices.size();
        if (n < 2) return 0;  // No transaction possible

        int minPrice = prices[0];
        int maxProfit = 0;

        for (int i = 1; i < n; ++i) {
            // Update profit if selling today yields more
            maxProfit = max(maxProfit, prices[i] - minPrice);
            // Update the minimum price seen so far
            minPrice = min(minPrice, prices[i]);
        }
        return maxProfit;
    }

```
